A NEIGHBOURHOOD ON A STREET CALLED PRIVET DRIVE. AN OWL, SITTING ON THE STREET SIGN FLIES OFF TO REVEAL A MYSTERIOUS APPEARING OLD MAN WALKING THROUGH A FOREST NEAR THE STREET. HE STOPS AT THE START OF THE STREET AND TAKES OUT A MECHANICAL DEVICE AND ZAPS ALL THE LIGHT OUT OF THE LAMPPOSTS. HE PUTS AWAY THE DEVICE AND A CAT MEOWS. THE MAN, ALBUS DUMBLEDORE, LOOKS DOWN AT THE CAT, WHICH IS A TABBY AND IS SITTING ON A BRICK LEDGE.
